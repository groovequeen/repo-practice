        <p class="paragraphs">Hi, my name is Sara. I grew up in California and moved to Boston to pursue my Bacherlor's in Music. After finishing school, 
        I began to professionally teach and perform music around the world. After several years of actively gigging, I decided to change 
        things up and become more involved with my church and our bi-vocational Coffee House which is located in downtown Boston. This non-profit 
        coffee house supports the local community by way of parterning with Boston non-profits and showcasing them for a month at each 
        location, they even donate some of their proceeds to those non-profits. After COVID-19 hit, several of us were forced to quit due to 
        the climate of the situation but has since surfaced the unique opportunity to learn coding with PreScholas. At PreScholas I can continue to 
        leverage my creativity and I'm thrilled to be a part of this program!
        </p>
